# Pyrepseq: the immune repertoire analysis toolkit

Pyrepseq is `scipy` & `seaborn` for studying adaptive immunity: modular implementations of algorithms for fast analyses, and bespoke plotting functions for compelling visualizations.

## Documentation and examples

You can find API documentation on [readthedocs](https://pyrepseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

There are jupyter notebooks illustrating some of the functionality in the 'examples' folder.

You can also find usage examples by looking at the code underlying our recent paper [Mayer Callan PNAS 2023](https://github.com/andim/paper_coincidences).

## Installation

The quickest way to install Pyrepseq is via pip:

`pip install pyrepseq`


Pyrepseq can also be installed from its [Github](https://github.com/andim/pyrepseq) source, by running `python setup.py install` in the main directory.

## Support and contributing

For bug reports and enhancement requests use the [Github issue tool](http://github.com/andim/pyrepseq/issues/new), or (even better!) open a [pull request](http://github.com/andim/pyrepseq/pulls) with relevant changes. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us by email (andimscience@gmail.com) or Twitter ([@andimscience](http://twitter.com/andimscience)).

You can run the testsuite by running `pytest` in the top-level directory.

You are cordially invited to [contribute](https://github.com/andim/pyrepseq/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the further development of pyrepseq!
